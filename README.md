# Merchant Scroll

Merchant Scroll is a Python project for Magic: the Gathering that formats a Moxfield collection export CSV file for Card Kingdom's Sell List CSV import tool. The script minimizes how many cards the CSV import tool fails to identify by applying Card Kingdom's card name formatting to the Moxfield CSV file. 

The project is named after [Merchant Scroll](https://scryfall.com/card/hml/33/merchant-scroll)
